Abstract Convection in rotating spherical layers of fluid is ubiquitous in spherical astrophysical objects like
planets and stars. A complete understanding of the magnetohydrodynamics requires understanding of the linear
problem‚Äîwhen convection onsets in these systems. This is a fluid dynamics problem that has been studied
since the early 1900s. Theoretical scaling laws exist for the variation of critical quantities‚Äîthe Rayleigh number
Rac, the azimuthal wavenumber mc, and the angular drift frequency œâc‚Äîwith respect to the Ekman number
E. However, their variation with the radius ratio œá of the spherical shell is still poorly studied. To address this,
we use an open source eigenvalue code Kore to compute these critical quantities over an extensive range of
parameters spanning four decades in Ekman number and a dense grid of radius ratio from very thick to very
thin shells, focusing on no-slip and fixed temperature boundary conditions. We find that these variations are
explained well by the theoretical scaling laws, especially at low E, but variations in radius ratio also exist. We
obtain scaling laws of boundary layer thicknesses and spatial extent of onset modes with respect to the Ekman
number which differ only slightly from theoretical scalings. We show that our data set can be used to obtain
good estimates of critical quantities in the moderate E range, where the vast majority of current geophysical
and astrophysical fluid dynamics simulations are performed, yet where asymptotic theory is only moderately
accurate. We further verify asymptotic predictions and determine best-fit asymptotic model coefficients.
Plain Language Summary Thermal buoyancy drives motions in the fluid layers of rotating planets
and stars throughout the universe. In this study, we use a large ensemble of numerical solutions to determine
the minimal strength of the thermal forcing needed to start such fluid motions, called convection. Further,
we predict the spatial structure of these rotating convective flows and their rate of azimuthal drift, all as a
function of spherical shell geometry and compare our results to previous studies. Our database of solutions
is made easily accessible to the broader scientific community via an online repository as well as Supporting
Information S1 Python notebook and data set.
1. Introduction
Convection in astrophysical objects such as planets and stars occurs in spherically symmetric rotating fluid layers.
Convection occurring under the influence of rotation determines heat transport and dynamics in these layers and
can drive jets, large-scale vortices, and dynamo action when the fluid is an electrical conductor. The specifics of the
magnetohydrodynamics in such a system are often determined by how far away the parameters of convection are
from those required for the onset of thermal convection (Aubert et al., 2017; Busse & Or, 1986; Calkins et al., 2016;
Christensen & Aubert, 2006; Gastine et al., 2016; Gillet & Jones, 2006; Julien, Knobloch, et al., 2012; Julien, Rubio,
et al., 2012). These convective fluid layers can span a range of geometries, from thin spherical shells such as atmospheres
and interiors of planets and moons (Amit et al., 2020; Aurnou et al., 2007, 2008; Heimpel & Aurnou, 2007; Heimpel
et al., 2022; Kaspi et al., 2020; Soderlund, 2019; Soderlund & Stanley, 2020), magma oceans (Labrosse et al., 2007;
Stixrude et al., 2020), and the solar convection zone (Christensen-Dalsgaard et al., 1991) to thick, such as the outer core
of the Earth (Olson, 2015). Thus, modeling fluid dynamics and dynamo processes in these objects requires knowledge
of the critical parameters of onset of rotating convection across a range of spherical shell geometries.
The classical setup for this problem is a fluid contained within a spherical shell having boundaries with inner and
outer radii ri and ro, respectively, and thickness L = ro ‚àí ri. The shell rotates at a rate Œ©, as shown in Figure 1.
The fluid is either heated volumetrically using uniformly distributed heat sources or differentially by fixing the

¬≠temperatures at both boundaries (Dormy et al., 2004). We focus on the latter
scenario in our present study. The temperatures at the inner and outer spherical
boundaries are held fixed at Ti and To, respectively, and we denote ŒîT = Ti ‚àí To.
The parameters governing the dynamics of the system are the Rayleigh number,
Ra = Œ±goŒîTL3/ŒΩŒ∫, which quantifies the strength of thermal driving; the Ekman
number, E = ŒΩ/Œ©L2 which is the ratio of the viscous drag to the Coriolis force;
the Prandtl number, Pr = ŒΩ/Œ∫ which is the ratio of viscosity to thermal diffusivity; and the spherical shell radius ratio œá = ri/ro. Here, Œ± is the coefficient of
thermal expansion and go is the acceleration due to gravity at the outer boundary. ŒΩ and Œ∫ describe the viscosity and thermal diffusivity of the fluid, respectively. The most common variation of gravity g(r) that is used is linear, g(r) ‚àù r,
emulating a terrestrial planet, though some studies have also used g(r) ‚àù 1/r2,
emulating the gravity environment of a star or gas giant (Gastine et al., 2016).
Convection in rotating spheres and spherical shells is a classical fluid dynamics problem (Jeffreys & Bland, 1951; Oberbeck, 1879; Pekeris, 1935). Early
comprehensive work on the topic was by Chandrasekhar (1961) who focused on
only axisymmetric modes, but considered both a fluid sphere as well as several
different shell radius ratios and a few different gravity profiles. Roberts (1968)
Figure 1. The geometry for studying onset of convection in rotating spherical
showed that for E ‚Üí 0 the first unstable convective mode is nonaxisymmetric in
(
)
shells. Subscripts ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúo,‚Äù respectively, denote quantities related to inner
an internally heated sphere and that the unstable modes have a width
ùê¥ùê¥ of Óàª ùê∏ùê∏ 1‚àï3
and outer boundaries.
while the critical Rayleigh number required for the onset of convection scales
as Rac ‚àº E‚àí4/3, the same scalings as those obtained by Chandrasekhar (1961)
for convection in a rotating plane layer. Busse (1970) considered a reduced annulus model, considering equatorially
symmetric solutions and provided a scaling for the drift frequency of the columnar thermal Rossby wave modes
œâc ‚àº E‚àí1/3, when time is scaled by the rotation rate of the annulus. This last scaling corresponds to œâc ‚àº E2/3 when time is
scaled by the viscous diffusion time (Dormy et al., 2004). At the onset of convection, these modes are quasi-geostrophic
with their motions being close to independent along the rotation axis (Busse, 1970, 1975, 1986, 1994, 2002). They
are essentially the thermal counterpart to Rossby modes in a spherical container and have a prograde drift (Busse &
Or, 1986). The numerical study of Zhang (1992) showed that the local analyses by Roberts and Busse could not explain
the numerical results. Following Soward (1977) and Yano (1992), Jones et al. (2000) performed a global stability analysis and obtained solutions that agreed with numerical results of Zhang (1992). It is worth noting that Busse's reduced
annulus model, despite its geometrical differences, has been instrumental in obtaining a fundamental understanding of
the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells (Calkins et al., 2013; Pino et al., 2000, 2001).
Beyond Chandrasekhar (1961), the study of onset of convection in spherical shells advanced with linear simulations of Gilman (1975) who focused on a differentially heated spherical shell filled with a fluid with Prandtl
number of unity and a shell radius ratio œá = ri/ro = 0.2, and confirmed that the variation of Rac, mc, and œâc tend
toward the scaling laws predicted by Roberts (1968) and Busse (1970) for a fluid sphere as the Ekman number
E is lowered. The study also carried out simulations with œá = 0.1 and 0.4 and reported that having a thinner
and thicker shell produces similar trends in the critical quantities with respect to E, with mc being larger for
thinner shells and smaller for thicker shells. The study used an inverse-squared gravity profile, showing that the
linear scaling laws of Busse (1970) are possibly independent of the gravity profile used. There have been several
numerical studies on the topic since then all of which focus on a uniformly heated spherical shell and a linear
gravity profile (Ardes et al., 1997; Zhang, 1991, 1992; Zhang & Busse, 1987; Zhang & Jones, 1993). The most
complete spherical shell study was done by Dormy et al. (2004) following the footsteps of the global stability
analysis of Jones et al. (2000). They analyzed both volumetrically and differentially heated spherical shells with
a linear gravity profile with the fluid having Pr = 1. They performed a WKB-approximation followed by an Airy
equation type analysis to obtain semianalytical solutions to the problem, which matched well with the numerical
solutions. However, all of the studies listed above focus on a few different values of the shell radius ratio. This
led Al-Shamali et al. (2004) to perform 3D simulations using the MagIC code (Wicht, 2002) for three different
E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí4 and several different radius ratios ranging from œá = 0.1 to œá = 0.92. They performed least-squares fit to
their data and obtained simple empirical rules of thumb for Rac and mc as a function of E and œá.
Our present study builds on the studies of Dormy et al. (2004) and Al-Shamali et al. (2004). We study the onset
of convection in differentially heated spherical shells with Pr = 1. We use the open source eigenvalue code Kore

(https://bitbucket.org/repepo/Kore/) to determine the critical parameters for convection (Rac, mc, œâc) for five
different E ranging from 10 ‚àí3 to 10 ‚àí7 and 31 different values of œá ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. To date, this is the
largest parameter space covered for this problem. Our aim is to determine these critical quantities as a function of
E and œá and to make the database of critical quantities openly available to the user community.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the governing equations. Section 3 provides the details of
the numerical method used to solve the eigenvalue problem and to determine the critical quantities for onset of
convection. Section 4 then discusses the results, considering the trends in mc, followed by the trends in Rac and
œâc. Thereafter, we analyze the thickness of the viscous boundary layers, the radial extent of the convective modes,
and the spiral nature of these modes. Section 5 compares our numerical solutions to the asymptotic theory of
Dormy et al. (2004). Section 6 discusses how our data set can be used to estimate critical quantities through interpolation. The main text of the paper ends with a summary and discussion in Section 7. Appendix A provides the
spectral formulation of viscous dissipation. The data set of critical quantities, data for profiles of viscous dissipation and kinetic energy, along with a Jupyter Notebook and other scripts to analyze them are provided as Supporting Information S1 and are available at https://github.com/AnkitBarik/convection_onset_radratio (Barik, 2022).
These will help generate the figures and tables provided in the paper.

2. Governing Equations
The setup consists of a viscous incompressible fluid inside a spherical shell with thickness L = ro ‚àí ri, rotating
at a rate Œ©, as shown in Figure 1. The temperature difference between the two spherical boundaries is held
fixed at ŒîT = Ti ‚àí To, where subscripts i and o denote quantities at inner and outer boundaries, respectively. We
restrict ourselves to fixed temperature boundary conditions at both boundaries for this study. The fundamental
equations governing the fluid dynamics of the system are the Navier-Stokes and heat equations combined with
mass continuity

Equation 19 is solved using a shift-and-invert spectral transformation with
the packages PETSc (Balay et al., 1997, 2019, 2021) and SLEPc (Hernandez
et al., 2005; Roman et al., 2019), which in turn use the parallel MUMPS solver
(Amestoy et al., 2001, 2006). The eigenvalue code to assemble and solve the
problem is called Kore. It is open source and has been used for computing rotational eigenmodes of planets in
Rekier et al. (2019) and Triana et al. (2021) where further details of the numerical method can also be found.
Kore can compute eigenmodes of any combination of rotating Navier-Stokes, magnetic induction, thermal,
and chemical transport equations and can work with extreme, near-realistic planetary parameters such as those
in Triana et al. (2021). All commonly employed boundary conditions are available to use such as no-slip/freeslip for mechanical, fixed temperature/heat-flux for thermal and conducting/insulating boundaries for magnetic
boundary conditions. The heating mode can be chosen to be differential (as in this study) or using internal heat
sources. Kore can also optionally be run without an inner core. From our own tests, the optimum number of
cpu's for a single eigenvalue calculation is between 14 and 24, regardless of the size of the matrices. Large size
computations are in fact memory bound, and adding more cpu's might even be detrimental. Ultimately, roundoff errors are the limiting factor to large problems (i.e., small Ekman numbers). Additionally, we use the SHTns
library (Ishioka, 2018; Schaeffer, 2013) for spherical harmonic transforms during postprocessing.

The black cross marks the critical values.

3.1. Example Case
For a fixed E and œá, we survey different azimuthal symmetries m and determine the corresponding critical
Rayleigh numbers Rac for convection, when the real part of the eigenvalue becomes positive. For each m value,
we provide an initial guess Ra1. A function takes the growth rate œÉ1 for Ra1 and searches around that value for an
Ra2 such that the corresponding growth rate œÉ2 has the opposite sign, œÉ1œÉ2 < 0. Once the two bounds are found,
we perform a root-finding search using Brent's method to determine the critical value Rac at which œÉc = 0 up to a
tolerance of 10 ‚àí6 in log10(Rac). We repeat the previous two steps for several m and find a trend in Rac (Figure 2).
The minimum of the curve gives the value of the critical Rayleigh number Rac for this set of E and œá values, as
well as the corresponding azimuthal wavenumber mc and the critical drift frequency œâc of the thermal Rossby
mode at the onset of convection. The example shown is at E = 10 ‚àí5 and œá = 0.35 for which Rac = 1.05567 √ó 10 7,
mc = 15 in good agreement with values listed in Table 1 of Christensen and Aubert (2006). We benchmarked our
code against some of the cases from Table 5 of Dormy et al. (2004) for œá = 0.35. The values we obtain differ by
<0.1% in Rac and less than half a percent in œâc, as listed in Table 1.

4. Results
Using the above method, we computed the critical values of the set (mc, Rac, œâc) for the onset of convection for the
following control parameters: E = (10 ‚àí3, 10 ‚àí4, 10 ‚àí5, 10 ‚àí6, 10 ‚àí7), and œá = 0.05 to 0.95 in steps of 0.03. The results
are summarized in Figure 3. We recall the leading order asymptotic scalings of these quantities with respect to
the Ekman number, obtained by linear stability analyses (Busse, 1970; Dormy et al., 2004; Gilman, 1975; Jones
et al., 2000; Roberts, 1968).

tion and thus, a spherical shell needs a higher thermal driving or Rayleigh number for the onset of convection at
lower Ekman numbers. Equation 23 tells us that as the Ekman number is reduced, the convective thermal Rossby
modes drift with a progressively lower angular frequency.
4.1. Variation in mc
The variation of the critical azimuthal wavenumber mc with E and œá is shown in Figure 3a. The critical wavenumber mc increases at lower E and higher œá (equivalent to thinner shells). We compensate mc with an E 1/3 scaling
(Equation 21) in Figure 3b demonstrating how the curves for different Ekman numbers collapse onto a single
curve. The onset of convection for the differential heating setup always takes place at the cylinder tangent to the
inner sphere at the equator, also known as the tangent cylinder (TC; Dormy et al., 2004). Thus, the number of
convective cells or columns is restricted by the circumference of the TC with respect to the shell thickness, i.e.,
mc ‚àù 2œÄri/L = 2œÄœá/(1 ‚àí œá). This explains the increase of mc with œá. Mathematically

In order to verify the accuracy of Equation 25, we compare our prediction against actual values for different
parameters in Table 2. The predicted values are close to the actual values with a mean error of about 15%.
4.2. Variation of Rac
Rac values increase with decreasing Ekman number as expected from linear theory of rotating convection and
decrease with increasing radius ratio, qualitatively similar to that observed by Al-Shamali et al. (2004). As shown
in Figure 3c, the trend of Rac with respect to œá are curves which are flat near the middle with horizontal ‚ÄúS‚Äù-shaped
variations near the ends. The curves look similar for all E. We compensate the
values by the asymptotic scaling and plot RacE 4/3 with respect to œá, providing Figure 3d. The asymptotic scaling leads to a relatively good collapse of
the curves for all œá, with the variation in RacE 4/3 being less than 2 orders of
magnitude compared to the variation in Rac values which are close to 6 orders
of magnitude. However, the range by which the data collapses with this scaling is much better for higher values of œá. An attempt to improve the collapse
by using outer boundary radius as the length scale did not work. Switching
to ro as length scale implies a multiplication of RacE 4/3 by (1 ‚àí œá) 1/3, which is
close to order unity for the full range in œá (ranges from ‚àº0.4 to ‚àº1).

Figure 5 plots RacE 4/3 with respect to E for different values of œá. This visualization makes clear that the Rac values asymptotically approach the linear
scaling for all radius ratios. However, the asymptotic scaling is first reached
at higher Ekman numbers in the thinner shells (higher œá). The approach to
asymptoticity is best seen for œá = 0.35 where we perform additional computations and extend the range of E to 10 ‚àí9.

Since the wavenumber, m is always positive in the convention followed in
this study, negative frequencies (œâ < 0) indicate modes that drift in the same
direction as the rotation of the shell (prograde). Since thermal Rossby waves
in spherical shells outside the TC at the onset of convection, are prograde in
nature (Busse & Or, 1986), all our mode frequencies are thus negative and
we focus on their magnitudes. As seen in Figure 3e, the magnitudes of œâc
decrease with E in general, as expected from linear theory. For each E, |œâc|
increases with œá, reaches a flat middle and then decreases again. The curve
for E = 10 ‚àí3 is the only one that crosses other curves for E = 10 ‚àí4 and 10 ‚àí5.
Figure 3f shows that the asymptotic scaling œâc ‚àº E 1/3 collapses the curves well
for different E, especially those at low E. Similar to Figure 5 for Rac, we plot
œâcE ‚àí1/3 with respect to E for different values of œá in Figure 6. This shows that
the œâc values approach an asymptotic scaling as E is lowered, for all radius
ratios. This is especially evident from the low E, œá = 0.35 curve. However, it
can be seen that the asymptotic regime is reached at higher Ekman numbers
for low and moderate radius ratios but requires lower E for thinner shells.

4.4. Mode Morphology
The morphology of the convective modes is a function of E and œá. All the Pr = 1 onset modes are quasi-geostrophic,
are attached to the TC, and satisfy the Taylor-Proudman constraint to leading order. Figure 7 shows equatorial
slices of radial velocity at two different Ekman numbers and three different radius ratios and is illustrative of the
effect of both parameters on onset mode morphology. In particular, we can see that a lower Ekman number leads
to thinner columns concentrated closer to the TC. Thicker shells have modes spiraling outward from the TC while
modes in thinner shells get progressively more oriented along the cylindrical radial direction. This is similar to
findings in the case of a cylindrical annulus by Pino et al. (2000, 2001). Furthermore, it is known that the thickness of the boundary layers and the extent of the modes in cylindrical radius (perpendicular to the rotation axis)
depend on the Ekman number under consideration (Dormy et al., 2004).
4.4.1. Boundary Layers
To determine the thickness of the viscous boundary layers, we use radial profiles of viscous dissipation
ùê¥ùê¥
Óà∞ùúàùúà (ùëüùëü),
which can be computed in spectral space (expression provided in Appendix A). We use a slope intersection
method similar to Gastine et al. (2015). Two examples are shown in Figure 8 for E = 10 ‚àí6 and œá = 0.5. The boundary layer thickness is determined by the intersection of a linear fit to the dissipation profile near the boundary with
a linear fit to the bulk profile near the boundary, beyond the ‚Äúelbow‚Äù of the curve. These are marked by black
dashed lines in Figure 8. For the outer boundary, we consider (ro ‚àí r)/E 1/2 ‚â§ 20 while for the inner boundary, we
consider (r ‚àí ri)/E 1/3 ‚â§ 5. These choices are made to restrict ourselves to regions near the boundaries and avoid
regions in the bulk where these profiles become unfavorable to linear fit,
especially for thin shells. E 1/2 and E 1/3 factors are motivated by theoretical
boundary layer thickness scalings (Dormy et al., 2004; Proudman, 1956).

Figure 5. Plot of Rac versus E, with the compensated scaling Equation 22 for
different values of œá. The case of œá = 0.35, shown in black, has been computed
over the range 10 ‚àí9 ‚â§ E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí3.

BARIK ET AL.

Figure 9a shows the variation of spherically averaged boundary layer thickness
at the outer boundary, Œ¥o, as a function of E and œá. As expected, Œ¥o decreases
with Ekman number and there is very little variation with œá. For each value
of œá, we fit an exponential law Œ¥o = a(œá)E b(œá) to the data for 10 ‚àí4 ‚â§ E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí7.
This yields Figure 9b. We see that the exponent b shows very little variation
and is constant around 0.5 with a mean of 0.506 ¬± 0.005. Thus, the thickness
of the outer boundary scales the same as a classic Ekman layer in a rotating spherical shell, Œ¥o ‚àù E 1/2 (Proudman, 1956). The prefactor a shows an
increase with œá but is always
ùê¥ùê¥ of Óàª(1). Figures 9d and 9e show the same analysis repeated for the inner boundary layer where Dormy et al. (2004) predict a
scaling of E 1/3 for the boundary layer thickness at the inner boundary. We find

hence the boundary layer thickness near the inner boundary are dependent on latitude. However, taking a mean
over all colatitudes leads to a boundary layer thickness that coincides with that at the equator (Figure 10b). This
is the reason why the boundary layer thickness near the inner boundary is dominated by the equatorial Ekman
layer scaling as noted above. For the boundary layer near the outer boundary, however, the profiles are quite
similar to each other and lead to similar boundary layer thickness (Figure 10c). Estimating the boundary layer
thickness using horizontal velocity leads to similar scalings as those obtained from dissipation profiles as shown
in Figures 9c and 9f. The scaling laws are summarized in Table 3.

from the TC by E 2/9 provides an excellent collapse of the kinetic energy profiles for all Ekman numbers. This
is shown for three different values of œá in Figure 11. This is consistent with the E 2/9 scaling provided by Dormy
et al. (2004), with very little variation with radius ratio. We find that the kinetic energy of the modes in all cases
is limited to an extent around (s ‚àí ri)/E 2/9 ‚âà 5 which gives us the scaling law

depends on the thickness of the shell. For thick shells, the modes tend to spiral out in a more curvilinear fashion
as compared to thin shells where the modes extend almost linearly outwards. In order to quantify the curvilinear
nature of the modes, we use a comparison to the Archimedean spiral: s = bœï, whose curvature is proportional to
1/b = dœï/ds. For each mode, we use an equatorial slice and track the phase difference in subsequent radial levels
using cross correlation of normalized radial velocity at that radial level against the normalized radial velocity at
smax, till the cylindrical radial extent smax of the mode is reached (Figure 12b). Thereafter, we quantify the curvature of the mode using ratio of the maximum extent of the mode in azimuth (Œîœï) to that in cylindrical radius
(Œîs) (Figure 12c). We see that the curvature goes down with shell thickness, agreeing with our conclusions using
a visual inspection of Figure 7. Interestingly the spiralization does not seem to strongly depend on the Ekman
number.

5. Comparison With Asymptotic Theory

Since a correction to both the critical wavenumber and drift frequency is not possible using the asymptotic theory,
we follow the same strategy as Dormy et al. (2004) and use the numerical values of mc (appropriately interpolated to obtain smooth curves). Dormy et al. (2004) provides values for these corrections for differential heating
only for œá = 0.35. We use them and compare our numerical solutions, shown
in blue in Figures 13 and 14. In case of Rac, the two agree very well, especially
for E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí5. For œâc, the agreement becomes progressively better for

for œá = 0.35 shows the curve obtained when using values for corrections provided in Dormy et al. (2004), while dashed blue
line shows the same obtained using a least-squares fit for E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí5. Solid lines for other œá values show a least-squares fit for
E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí5, extended to nonasymptotic values (dotted lines).

6. Using This Data Set
Due to the broad parameter space covered, the data set of critical quantities generated from this study can be
used to estimate critical quantities anywhere in the range covered through interpolation. With our dense coverage in œá, we find that none of the critical quantities have a very large variation from one œá value to the next.
Thus, to estimate mc and Rac at a certain E and œá value, one can consider the data at the nearest œá that we have
computed. Thereafter, fitting a scaling law against E and interpolating to the desired E will yield the desired
critical quantities. Figure 16 illustrates a case for E = 3 √ó 10 ‚àí6 and œá = 0.81. Radius ratio œá = 0.81 does not
exist in our database; hence, we consider the data at the nearest radius ratio in our data set, œá = 0.80. Thereafter, we perform a linear fit in E. The cyan triangles mark the values computed using Kore which lie pretty
well on the straight line fit. Table 5 lists critical values computed with Kore at three randomly chosen E and
œá not present in the data set and compares them with values obtained by interpolation as well as Equation 25
for mc. The errors in estimation are at most 13% for Rac and 5% for mc, illustrating the usefulness of the data
set. Further, one may use our data set to obtain least-squares fit values for higher order correction terms in
the asymptotic theory of Dormy et al. (2004), providing critical quantity estimates beyond the ranges of our
current computational capabilities.

7. Summary and Discussion
In this study, the heat equation has been added to sparse spectral eigenvalue code Kore, enabling the investigation of the onset of convection in rotating spherical shells. We have built upon previous studies and performed an
extensive exploration of the parameter space in Ekman number 10 ‚àí3 ‚â§ E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí7 and radius ratio 0.05 ‚â§ œá = ri/
ro ‚â§ 0.95 and computed the critical wavenumber mc, the critical Rayleigh number Rac and the critical drift
frequency œâc at the onset of convection. As predicted by asymptotic scaling laws (Busse, 1970; Dormy et al., 2004;
Roberts, 1968), mc obeys mc ‚àº E ‚àí1/3 across all radius ratio values; however, there is a strong increase with œá. This
can be explained considering that mc is proportional to the circumference of the TC, giving us a rule of thumb that
predicts mc to within a mean error of about 15%. In case of Rac, the asymptotic scaling law Rac ‚àº E ‚àí4/3 explains
the trend in Rac, especially at low E, while Rac monotonically decreases with radius ratio. Thinner shells (high œá)

first approach the asymptotic scaling law at higher E compared to thicker shells. œâc has a nonmonotonic behavior
with œá‚Äîits magnitude increases with œá, reaches a plateau and then decreases again for thin shells.
The boundary layer thicknesses at inner and outer boundaries are determined independently using horizontally
averaged profiles of dissipation as well as horizontal (or nonradial) velocity. These yield scaling laws similar to a
classical Ekman layer at the outer boundary, Œ¥o ‚àº E 1/2 and that of an equatorial Ekman layer at the inner boundary, Œ¥i ‚àº E 2/5 (Marcotte et al., 2016; Stewartson, 1966). An analysis of azimuthally averaged horizontal velocity
profiles at different latitudes further confirms that the inner boundary layer thickness scaling comes from the
(
)
equatorial Ekman layer singularity
ùê¥ùê¥ of Óàª ùê∏ùê∏ 2‚àï5 . The convective modes are quasi-geostrophic, attached to the TC
and extend to a distance from the inner boundary given approximately by 5E 2/9. These modes are spiral in nature,
as have been noted in past studies (Dormy et al., 2004; Takehiro, 2008; Zhang, 1992). We quantify their spiral
nature using an approximation of an Archimedean spiral and show that the modes become less curvilinear as the
radius ratio increases. A comparison of our numerical solutions to the asymptotic theory of Dormy et al. (2004)
shows that the theory works really well across a wide range of Ekman numbers as well as radius ratios.
Our expansive data set of critical quantities spanning several decades in Ekman number and extending from
thinnest to thickest shell thicknesses allows interpolation of our results to most commonly used simulation parameters. It also enables extrapolation to planetary regimes. For œá = 0.35, we can use our extreme computations till
E = 10 ‚àí9 to obtain critical parameters at an Earth-like E ‚àº 10 ‚àí15. Extrapolating using data-points at E ‚â§ 10 ‚àí7, we

Inhomogenous thermal boundary conditions can have an effect on rotating convection in thin shells (Hori
et al., 2010; Terra-Nova et al., 2023; Yan & Stanley, 2021). This effect, near onset, depends on the relative scales
of the free convection and the thermal boundary anomaly. Novel phenomena such as resonance and locking
can occur when these two scales are comparable (Davies et al., 2009; Zhang & Gubbins, 1993). Due to a steep
increase in mc with radius ratio, convective scales become very small in thin shells. Thus, a clear scale separation
occurs between the convective length scales and the thermal boundary anomalies, which are usually large scale,
implying locking and resonance might be unlikely to occur in thin shell geometries.
The present study has focused on one set of mechanical and thermal boundary conditions: no-slip and fixed
temperatures as well as on a single Prandtl number of unity. Prandtl number dependence of convection is an
interesting problem in its own right (Zhang, 1992) and is beyond the scope of the current study. Given the broad
capabilities of the eigenvalue code Kore, this study leaves open room for future explorations of the influence of
Pr, different boundary conditions, heating modes, compositional convection, the influence of magnetic fields, all
of which can help us understand flows in planetary cores and atmospheres, subsurface oceans, and even stellar
convection zones.
